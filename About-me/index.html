     <p style="border-right: solid purple;"> My name is Lucy and I am 17 years old. I live in Tulsa Oklahoma and attend Jenks Highschool. When I graduate I plan on attending TCC for two years and then transfering to OU. I am not exactly sure what I want to major in yet but I have been thinking about veterinary science or sonography. I crrently live at home with my mom, step-dad, and older brother. </p>
     <p> My sister just recently moved to North Carolina to be with her boyfreind (ew). We have 5 pets, 4 of them being cats and then a pug. One of the cats is mine and her name is Kitty (I couldn't decide on a name). On my website you can find some of my favrite things.</p>
