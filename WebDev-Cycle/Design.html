        <h2>4. Design</h2>
        <p>The design stage focuses on creating the visual layout and user experience of the website based on the information, strategy, and content gathered in earlier stages. This is where designers translate goals and content into wireframes, mockups, and user interface plans that show how each page will look and how users will navigate through the site. Although design is its own step, it overlaps with the content and strategy stages because the layout must support the message, structure, and purpose that were already defined.</p>
