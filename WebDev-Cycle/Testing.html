        <p>The testing stage ensures that the website works correctly, loads efficiently, and behaves as expected on different devices and browsers. Testers look for bugs, broken links, design inconsistencies, performance issues, and accessibility problems. This stage overlaps closely with development, since many issues found during testing must be fixed by developers, which may lead to repeated cycles of testing and correction until the site meets quality standards.
