        <p>The maintenance stage begins after the website is live and focuses on keeping it running smoothly over time. This includes updating software and plugins, fixing issues that appear later, improving performance, and keeping the content up to date. Maintenance also ensures the site remains secure by monitoring for vulnerabilities and applying necessary updates. As user needs change, this stage may involve refining existing features or adding new ones. The goal of maintenance is to keep the website functional, secure, and current.</p>
