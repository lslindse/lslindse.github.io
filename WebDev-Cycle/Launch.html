            <p>The launch stage is the formal release of the website to the public. In this stage, the completed site is moved from the development environment to a live web server using the chosen hosting platform. The team configures server settings, uploads all site files, connects the database if needed, and ensures the domain name points to the live site. SSL certificates are installed so users can browse securely. This step also includes setting up essentials such as email services, content management access, analytics tools, and any required third party integrations. Once these components are in place, the website is published and made publicly accessible. The team may also offer basic support to administrators or editors as they begin working with the live site.
