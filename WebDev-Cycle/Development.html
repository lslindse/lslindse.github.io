        <p>The development stage is where the approved design is transformed into a functional website. Front end developers use HTML to structure the content of each page and CSS to style and format the layout so it matches the design mockups, while JavaScript is often used to add interactivity and dynamic features. Back end developers handle the server side components, such as databases, user accounts, data processing, and any interactive tools the site requires. This stage often overlaps with design and content because adjustments may need to be made as the site is built, especially when integrating real text, images, or features that behave differently than expected.
